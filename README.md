Welcome to the CS3610: Design patterns!

Each assignment of this module will consist a notebook file(s) (with a .ipynb extension) and several normal Python files (with .py extension).
The notebooks will serve as the driver of the assignments.
They will direct you to implement tasks (as your classes).


This requires a bit of setup.

0. Create a New Repository (cs3610_fall2025_NWP) on GitHub

1. Create a Virtual Environment for your Project in VSCode:
2. 
   1.1 Open a new VSCode session

   1.2 Open the Project in VSCode
     - clone a repository (you will be provided with a link) & open it in your workspace (I am using my repo for cs3220 course as an example here)
       <img width="1048" height="131" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c7d7653-5462-457e-a35f-cb0c409e8a94" />
       <img width="1396" height="787" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a0f0cae-38cf-464d-90b6-dfb65e23b2f3" />
       <img width="545" height="213" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec358bfe-1d45-45be-9fb2-fe9185e675f3" />
       <img width="976" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e0079ab-ad8d-4bfb-9493-7cf24c72aa50" />





   OR
     - download the assignment zip-file and unpack its content with a starter code(s) and a notebook(s) in your working folder
     - 
    1.3 Create a Python Virtual Environment
       
    1.4 Activate the virtual environment
   
    1.5 Install your desired (or required) dependencies
   
    1.6 Save Dependencies to requirements.txt (optional)
   
    1.7 Select Python Interpreter
   
    1.8 Creating a .gitignore File
   
       Add the following lines to your .gitignore file:
          .venv/
          .env
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
    
3. Complete your project(Working With Branches!!!):
   
   2.1 Create a new branch (for ex. cs3610_DP_A1) and switch to it (or Create a new branch from .... /my branch for the assignment from my repo/..)
   
   2.2 Make Changes and Commit
   
   2.3 Add Your Remote Repo - only once (or Push to your remote, NOT to my remote, PLEASE!!! ) (for ex., https://github.com/studName/cs3610_TestPractice.git)

   Check the video below to work with 2 repos.
